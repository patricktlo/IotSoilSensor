# Experimental values 

These are some tests I executed in order to estimate the noise.

The values are the ones given directly by the 12-bit ADC. If I remember correctly, sample time is 1 second.

ADC values are on the first column.

For the naming conventions:

avgX: means that the ADC used X-sample oversampling (executed at the hardware level).

capX: is the value of the capacitor connected to the ADC input.

gpio: means the power supply of the circuit was one GPIO pin of the microcontroller.
